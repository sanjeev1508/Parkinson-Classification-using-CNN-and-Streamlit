# Parkinson's Disease Detection

This project focuses on detecting Parkinson's disease using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a dataset containing voice and biomedical features to classify individuals as having Parkinson's disease or not.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Machine learning models for classification
- Model evaluation and accuracy assessment

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/parkinsons-detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd parkinsons-detection
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the main script to train and test the model:
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```
2. Modify parameters in `config.py` for tuning the model.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes biomedical voice measurements from individuals with and without Parkinson's disease.
